## Goals

Working from a provided basic static landing page created from HTML and CSS, the project goal was to create the JavaScript code necessary to add the following features:

1. Dyanamically generate the navigation bar based upon the sections present in the document
2. Scroll smoothly (instead of jumping) to the appropriate section when a navigation link is clicked
3. Determine which section is active on the document and make it stand out

## Author
